#
# This script sets up the Python environment and runs the server.
#
# It ensures 'uv' is installed, creates a virtual environment, and installs
# dependencies from the current project.
#
# USAGE:
#   ./run.sh                    - Silently installs dependencies and runs the server.
#   ./run.sh --install          - Verbosely installs dependencies, does not run the server.
#   ./run.sh -- --app-arg       - Passes arguments to the python server.

# Exit immediately if a command exits with a non-zero status.
# Treat unset variables as an error.
# The return value of a pipeline is the status of the last command to exit
# with a non-zero status, or zero if no command exited with a non-zero status.
